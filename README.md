# InfinitePeripheralExtension
The first iOS scanner app I had to do for my job was for Linea Pro 5's and I had a really hard time finding any documentation or development that was directed towards the Swift language. I would like to thank matheuscmpm for initially getting me started with his Lineaswift project.
I now have to deal with Infinea X's and I have spent some time bugging the people at Infinite Peripherals and scouring the internet for info. My company is now enjoying a smooth functioning Swift app we have 2 shipping apps that use it to be precise.
So I decided to share and I hope you get some use out of it whether you use it as is or just peice by peice.
